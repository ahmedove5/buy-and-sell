# buy-and-sell
# Idea:
 For a site where we can sell products or rent products, the distinctive idea in the application enables the user to rent products or display products so that the products are expensive and can be rented at a nominal price per day
 
# Inspiration:
 Sometimes we need products for a certain period or for one time, but their price is very expensive through the application. I can rent these products at a symbolic price
